# Python Support Vector Data Description

Python implementation of the Support Vector Data Descriptor classifier. Compatible with scikit-learn.
The code is written such that it aligns well with the paper by referencing to equation numbers and elaborate comments, i.e. suitable for research.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
* [cvxopt](https://pypi.org/project/cvxopt/)
* [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)/[Scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)

### Executing program

* Please refer to the test file for an example. A \_plot_contour function is provided to visualize the decision boundary on 2D data.
